The whole point is to survive against him as long as possible.

# Information:
This here is the source code of the game. It was built in Godot 4.3. This repo serves as a way to
look at the source code and as an additional resource for other game development projects. Ideally, you can 
use this to learn and see how a game is built on Godot. It's a free game, so feel free to find some useful stuff
in here for your own adventure. However, do not upload this repo or game as your own. You're welcome 
to see the code and use it, but please make sure you don't just copy and asset flip this.
